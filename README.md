# Daniel Arthur Gallagher

I'm a gay sofware engineer from Scotland and I live in Italy, in Milan.

## Work

I work for [Subito.it](https://www.subito.it), an online marketplace, and I'm a front-end specialist.

Since joining the company, I've worked on rebuilding the front-end of the listing and detail pages,
and rolling out a rebrand of the site.

My team focussed on web performance in Q2 of 2020 and with an effort across the whole company we
made a revolution in the performance of the site, as well as how we track it and think about it.

Now in Q3 I've started using some [Go](https://golang.org) to get more involved in creating and maintaining our services.
